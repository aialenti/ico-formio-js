### Changed
 - Moved the logout token and cache clearing to before the call is made to the server.

### Fixed
 - Bizarre issue that seems to be a bug in browser "fetch" library where it would introduce a response
   JWT token when a request was made without one. It was verified that the server was not sending
   the token in the response, so it is concluded that for some reason fetch was introducing it (cache maybe?).
   Regardless, we fixed it so that it will detect when a token was introduced and throw it out.
